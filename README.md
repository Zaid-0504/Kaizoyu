# Development

Kaizoyu is mostly coded in Java, but Kotlin code is welcome.
The project is fully compatible with latest Canary build of Android Studio, and importing
it there is the fastest way to get it working.

The [stable branch](https://github.com/astarivi/Kaizoyu/tree/stable) contains the latest
stable release source code, and the [main branch](https://github.com/astarivi/Kaizoyu/tree/main) contains
current development sources. You may target either one for PRs, but prefer stable for changes unrelated
to current development (which aren't likely to cause conflicts), or drastic changes (which will
cause conflicts).

Nonetheless, if you want to go the cool way:

- Fetch latest stable source (or target main):

```bash
git clone -b stable https://github.com/astarivi/Kaizoyu.git
cd Kaizoyu
```

- Download the Android SDK and make sure it's accessible.
  Check `app/build.gradle` `targetSdkVersion` value for the SDK level, and download that. Also,
  make sure Java >17 is available.

- Assemble debug APK:

```bash
gradlew assembleMainlineDebug
```

- Connect your phone, enable USB debugging, allow ADB from host PC, install it:

```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-universal-debug.apk
```

Or just use Android Studio Canary, get latest from [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/)
